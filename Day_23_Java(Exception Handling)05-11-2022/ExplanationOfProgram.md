<br>1. In main method we have try block which tries the instruction writen in it and executes them if there is no error.
<br>2. But if error occurs it throws the error out of try block and error is catched by the catch block.
<br>3. if error is related to that exception related to catch block for eg, arithmetic or input mismatch etc.. it will execute the instruction in related catch block.
