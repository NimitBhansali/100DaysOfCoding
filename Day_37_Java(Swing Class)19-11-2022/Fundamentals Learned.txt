Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications.
It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.

Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are a set of GUI components which simplify the development of desktop applications.
Commonly used Methods of Component class:-
- public void add(Component c)-> add a component on another component.
- public void setSize(int width,int height)->	sets size of the component.
- public void setLayout(LayoutManager m)->	sets the layout manager for the component.  
- public void setVisible(boolean b)->	sets the visibility of the component. It is by default false.

There are two ways to create a frame:
- By creating the object of Frame class (association)
- By extending Frame class (inheritance)
