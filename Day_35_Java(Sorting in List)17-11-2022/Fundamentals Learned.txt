-------------------Java List-----------------------
List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements.
It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.
The List interface is found in the java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.
It is a factory of ListIterator interface. Through the ListIterator, we can iterate the list in forward and backward directions.
The implementation classes of List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack and Vector. The ArrayList and LinkedList are widely used in Java programming. 
The Vector class is deprecated since Java 5.

List Interface declaration
  public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>  
 -- Some Inbuilt Methods are--
void add(int index, E element)-> It is used to insert the specified element at the specified position in a list.
boolean add(E e)-> It is used to append the specified element at the end of a list.
boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)-> 	It is used to append all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of a list.
boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c)->	It is used to append all the elements in the specified collection, starting at the specified position of the list.
void clear()-> 	It is used to remove all of the elements from this list.
boolean equals(Object o)->	It is used to compare the specified object with the elements of a list.
