-------------------Java List-----------------------
List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements.
It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.
The List interface is found in the java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.
It is a factory of ListIterator interface. Through the ListIterator, we can iterate the list in forward and backward directions.
The implementation classes of List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack and Vector. The ArrayList and LinkedList are widely used in Java programming. 
The Vector class is deprecated since Java 5.

List Interface declaration
  public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>
