<h2>Queue using Linked List</h2>
<br>In a Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, <b>front</b>, and <b>rear</b>. The front points to the first item of the queue and rear points to the last item.

<br><b>enQueue()</b>-- This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.
<br><b>deQueue()</b>-- This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.
