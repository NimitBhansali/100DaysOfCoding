<h3>Explanation-</h3>
<br>1. In Main method we have Scanner class to take input of n(to be size of array) and then array created of the size n.
<br>2. With For loop we have taken input for array elements
<br>3. Sum and count initialized with 0 so that no garbage value is stored.
<br>4. Nested Loop is used to add to certain elements and see if they are less than zero(negative integer) if yes then counter needs to be incremented.
<br>5. Sum is assigned 0 after inner loop as it will also be used in inner loop again so it should start from 0. Now, The count is printed after the loops complete.
