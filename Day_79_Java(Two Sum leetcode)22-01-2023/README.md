<h2>Two Sum  (Leet Code)</h2>
<br><b>Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

<br>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.You can return the answer in any order.
<br>
<br>
Example 1:
  
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
<br>Output: [0,1]
<br>Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
<br>
  
Example 2:
<br>Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
<br>Output: [1,2]</b>
