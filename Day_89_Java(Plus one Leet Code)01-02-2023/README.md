<h1>Plus One from Leetcode</h1>
<b>You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order.
<br>The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Example 1:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
<br>Output: [4,3,2,2]
<br>Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
<br>Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

<br>Example 2:

 Input: digits = [9]
<br>Output: [1,0]
<br>Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
<br>Thus, the result should be [1,0]./<b>
