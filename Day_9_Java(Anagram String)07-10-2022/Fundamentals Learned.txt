#  Java Basics  
 Class: The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). It can be defined as a template that describes the data and behaviour associated with its instance.
    	Example: Blueprint of the house is class.
      Syntax -
          class FirstClass {
              //Statements
          }

Object: The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behaviour and state.
      	Example: A car is an object whose states are: brand, colour, and number plate.
        Behaviour: Running on the road.
        Method: The behaviour of an object is the method.
        Instance variables: Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.
Comments in Java
There are three types of comments in Java. 
  -Single line Comment
      // System.out.println("SIngle");
  -Multi-line Comment
      /*  for (i=0;i<10;i++)
          System.out.println("CAN BE AnYThing in B/w");
      */
  -Documentation Comment. Also called a doc comment.
      ***When the class is public, the name of the file has to be the class name.***

Note- Java is Case Sensitive i.e.. identifiers AB, Ab, aB, and ab are different in Java.
