<h2> Explanation </h2>

<br>1. We took String in A with help of scanner class
<br>2. Reverse variable is used to store reverse of the string 
<br>3. loop is started from i=0 as string first letter is at 0 index
<br>4. now we take c as char and store value of each letter of string one by one into c .
<br>5. then c is stored into reverse variable in reverse order with '+' operation.
<br>6. As we come out from loop we have two strings(A and reverse) We comapre them with compareTo function. Yes is printed if both String matches else No is printed.
