<h2>Stack using singly linked list</h2>
All the singly linked list operations should be performed based on Stack operations LIFO(last in first out) and with the help of that knowledge, we are going to implement a stack using a singly linked list. 

So we need to follow a simple rule in the implementation of a stack which is last in first out and all the operations(PUSH,POP,DISPLAY) can be performed with the help of a top variable
