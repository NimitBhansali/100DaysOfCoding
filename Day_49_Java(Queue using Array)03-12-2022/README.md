<h2>Queue</h2>
<br>A queue is data structure that is based on first-in first-out (FIFO) in which the first item input is also the first item removed.
<br>Items are added to the end of the line and removed from the beginning.
<br>When utilising an array to construct a queue, the fact that an array has a fixed size once declared poses an issue in the queue implementation. When elements are added to a queue and then deleted, a gap is created. To fill the gap, we can rearrange the remaining components to fill the space, but it is a time-consuming procedure.

<h4>Queue Operations</h4>
<br>For a Queue-based system these three operations are used:

<br><b>Enqueue:</b> To add an item at the back / rear end of the queue.
<br><b>Dequeue:</b> To delete an item from the front of the queue.
<br><b>peek:</b> Get a value from the front of the queue without having to remove it.
