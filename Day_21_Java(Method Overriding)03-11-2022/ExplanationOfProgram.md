<h3>Explanation-</h3>
<br>1. First we created a Sports named class with 2 methods i.e. getName() and getNumberOfTeamMembers() with some instructions.
<br>2. Next we created a Soccer class which extended sports class we had to use Overriding so we declared @overide before we write any method.
<br>3. In soccer class we have exact same methods created like in Sports class just the print value is different.
<br>4. In public class's main method we have 2 objects of 2 classes created there respective class methods are called wth almost similar output.
<br>So overriding is- When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it also inherits its methods; however, it can also override the superclass methods (as well as declare and implement new ones).
