<h3>Explanation-</h3>
<br>1. In main method we have scanner class variable scan to take input.
<br>2. In n we store size of the array to be created.
<br>3. Then we declare n size array.
<br>4. Using for loop we start a val variable from 0 as the array index starts from 0 to n-1 so we make val run till less than n.
<br>5. in loop we give a[0],a[1],...a[n-1] values.
<br>6. In second for loop we have values printed one by one using index variable as i which also starts from 0 to n-1 and print the values of a[0],a[1],...a[n-1].
