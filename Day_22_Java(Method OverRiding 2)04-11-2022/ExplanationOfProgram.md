<h3>Explanation-</h3>
<br>1. First we created BiCycle named class with method i.e. define_me() with some instructions.
<br>2. Next we created a MotorCycle class which extended BiCycle class.
<br>3. In MotorCycle class we have exact same methods created like in BiCycle class just the return value is different.
<br>4. Then in MotorCycle class we have a method created with same name as MotorCycle(which is also Class name) its called constructor of the class.
<br>5. In constructor we have First line as printing the string and define_me() method is called of the MotorCycle class 
<br>6. Now temp has string returned from superclass(BiCycle) define_me() (method)  using 'super' keyword which calls super class's method.
<br>7. Constructor of the class is called automatically when a object(M) of the class is created so its called.
