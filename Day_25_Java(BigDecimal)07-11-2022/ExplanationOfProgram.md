<h3>Explanation-</h3>
<br>1. In main method we took n as input of array size  and string array is created with that size n+2.
<br>2. Then in for loop took input for string is taken using scanner object sc.
<br>3. Now main sorting part is done with help of 2 for loop, in outer loop we stared with last element moving j backward.
<br>4. Inner loop i goes from starting element of array upto j th element and then we stored curr and currNext as alternate elements.
<br>5. We compared curr and currNext if comparison gave output as negative integer that means curr is smaller then currNext .
<br>6. If the output is negative integer then we swap elements and transfer the smallest element to last.
<br>7. Finally sorting completes j-- and i++ will make i=j in b/w where array will sorted in descending order.
<br>8. Then we printed the sorted array with for loop.
