# Explanation of Code-
<br>  1. In main function we have taken input s for string and k for integer
<br>  2. And we pass the s,k in getSmallestAndLargest() function
<br>  3. now in getSmallestAndLargest() function we have two varable with string data types
<br>  4. smallest is assigned value upto k-1 index of string
<br>  5. now for loop we have started it from i=0 as string starts from 0 index 
<br>  6. we run the loop upto length - k as we can take last number of index of string left to use it as last
<br>  7. now we use compareTo function which Compares two strings lexicographically. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings.
<br>  8.  returning values at last of two variable as a string
